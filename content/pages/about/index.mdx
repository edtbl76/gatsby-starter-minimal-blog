Hello there, I'm Ed!

I'm a technologist, writer, leader, and business enthusiast with a proven track record. I've had the privilege of working at prestigious companies like Amazon, Oracle, PTC, iRobot, and Thoughtworks. But beyond the logos, what truly enriches my journey is the people I meet along the way.

My situational leadership style is highly adaptive. I assess team capabilities and objectives to tailor my approach—sometimes directive, sometimes supportive. This flexibility optimizes team dynamics and productivity, ensuring effective leadership and promoting individual growth and team success.

My playground is the realm of software and innovation. As an explorer, I eagerly push boundaries in distributed systems, software platforms, AI, and data science. I thrive on nascent challenges and love exploring these frontiers with others who share my enthusiasm for peering into the horizon with excitement.

I'm just as devoted to guiding businesses with strategic vision as I am to technology. I'm inspired by the potential to transform and reinvent industries to create new possibilities. I don't want to be the sails of the macroenvironment; I want to be the wind.

My passions lie in non-profit initiatives and charitable organizations, especially those focused on advancing sustainability, literacy, access to education, bridging the digital divide, enhancing government transparency, and fostering economic fairness. These sectors inspire my commitment to driving meaningful societal change.

I'm dedicated to perpetual learning. I have a BA in music and mathematics and an MBA with concentrations in Strategy, Finance, and Analytics. I'm wrapping up an  MSc in Computer Science, specializing in Distributed Systems, AI, and ML. Sharing knowledge through teaching and coaching is every bit as rewarding as the time spent obtaining it. And speaking of teaching, I love it so much that I married a teacher!

Outside of the professional realm, I'm a dad, husband, musician, runner, beagle herder, and an enthusiast of the fight sciences. These facets of my life are integral to who I am. They bring balance, joy, and a unique perspective to my work. I believe in the power of a well-rounded life.
